# Project 1: certified_preowned_processor
### CS3650: Computer Architecture
Christian Badoy, Scott Lee, Lynn Takahashi

#### Objective:

This project adds to the ALU project in both functionality and complexity, and puts your understanding of Chapter 4.4 to the test. Gain more experience and understanding in Verilog.

(The name denotes the availability of helpful (if you make it so) resources from countless people who have "been there, done that". But the skills, knowledge, and experience would still be beautiful when they finally become yours.)


#### Tasks:

(100 pts) At a minimum, implement the single-cycle implementation as described in 4.4, handling the subset of instructions (ALU funcs, lw/sw, beq, jump) mentioned.

(20 pts) Implement 5-stage pipelining as shown in 4.7.



#### Code implementation  
An implementation of a 32-bit single cycle MIPS processor in Verilog: https://github.com/diadatp/mips_cpu
